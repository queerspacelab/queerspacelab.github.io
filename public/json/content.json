    "abstract": "<p>Since COVID-19 first broke out in 2020, China has performed a zero-tolerance policy combating the public health crisis, including rounds of city-wide lockdown. The stringent lockdown policy, which never got lifted in the past two years. Following lockdowns, measurements such as the conduction of massive PCR testing across the city and the implementation of the green-code system to survey, monitor, and record individuals' health conditions disrupted the pre-COVID daily routine to become the new norm. Many have adopted lockdown as an abnormal yet everyday lifestyle in the country, while others are actively seeking alternatives to bring back the daily life before COVID-19 and create a sense of belonging in the community despite the reality of physical isolation. Socially, when most offline event spaces were confined to precautionary inspection, social media linked people together, helping form all kinds of virtual neighborhoods. Some of these were based on a chatgroup structure, though temporary, worked autonomously, and succeeded in providing members with resources to life supplies, medical services, and social support.</p><img src='images/Shanghai_Lockdown_Queer_Life_0.jpg'><p>This project is a collection of slices of life in the scenes mentioned above during the 2022 Shanghai lockdown from people who self-identified as queer. It tries to reflect on their personal experience of seeking comfort in living space, adjusting distances between themselves and others, and redefining daily habits in the quarantine. The project is meant to archive the emotions and feelings of ordinary people, which are undercovered mainly by the official media streams, as these narratives of <b>how the public lives a life</b> are unnecessary or less important compared to the rendering of heroic storytelling of the COVID-19 front line.</p>",    "img": "emerson.jpg",

    "title": "/s/ /z/",
    "abstract": "<p>/s/ /z/ is a personal voice archive that wedges speech therapy practices, mimicry, and repetition. It serves as a contemplative view on how the voice is subject to queerness and the implications of that relationship. /s/ /z/ aims to tackle the question of “how does a voice get queered (both by a speaker and by a listener)”? It explores how it is viewed on both a linguistic and psychological level and the resulting processes of institutionalization by society and media. /s/ /z/ expands on ideas of queering being amplified by mimicry and repetition in relation to the voice, and broadly how the “lisp” is interrogated. /s/ /z/ investigates speech therapy techniques; particularly practices to make a stereotypical gay male voice sound more stereotypically straight. Ultimately, the project converges on the question of “how does the voice spatialize and contextualize a queer body”?</p><img src='images/s_z_0.jpg'><p>In this first addition to the /s/ /z/ archive, the artist recorded himself saying the 50 most common English words in his voice and then in a “speech therapized” voice. The result is an audiovisual project that deploys the cut and two-channel sound to ask what it means to have a queer voice.</p>",

    "title": "Minor Presence: [Un]accountable history of Harvard’s Lamont Library - Part 1",
    "abstract": "<p>There are two ways of reading institutions. The first way is the “image” of the institution. The image is the official way an institution wishes to be read by the public. The second way of reading an institution is through its “presence.”  Presence is the reciprocal relationship and shaping between the institution and those interacting with it. The latter relationship of presence is often unacknowledged because it troubles the logical reading of an institution's image. The library as an institution is par excellence an archival space dedicated to the official telling of history and distribution of information.</p><img src='/images/minor_presence_0.jpg'><p>This initial part of our project is the first trip into a series of questions we are engaging with about the institutional library as a space. It is divided into 5 reflections. In reflection 1, we discussed our use of a queer methodology through the frame of the minor. Reflections 2 and 3 gave a brief historical account of the library as an institutional space and looked into Harvard’s Lamont library as a case study. Reflection 4 helps us to pin down a few key definitions. Through the framework of the minor, we introduce the distinction between the image of a space and its presence. To conclude we reflect on the potentialities that come from remixing, reordering, and redistributing the popular.</p><p>We have been writing these reflections asynchronously, and as we write along, they are increasingly in conversation with each other. Weaving together these 5 pairs of loosely defined reflections, we hope to present our intention towards remixing knowledge in different contexts, and producing a “messy” research project that hesitates to be fully linear in direction.</p> ",
