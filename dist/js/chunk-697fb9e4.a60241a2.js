The stringent lockdown policy, which never got lifted in the past two years. Following lockdowns, measurements such as the conduction of massive PCR testing across the city and the implementation of the green-code system to survey, monitor, and record individuals\' health conditions disrupted the pre-COVID daily routine to become the new norm. Many have adopted lockdown as an abnormal yet everyday lifestyle in the country, while others are actively seeking alternatives to bring back the daily life before COVID-19 and create a sense of belonging in the community despite the reality of physical isolation. Socially, when most offline event spaces were confined to precautionary inspection, social media linked people together, helping form all kinds of virtual neighborhoods. Some of these were based on a chatgroup structure, though temporary, worked autonomously, and succeeded in providing members with resources to life supplies, medical services, and social support.</p><img src=\'images/Shanghai_Lockdown_Queer_Life_0.jpg\'><p>This project is a collection of slices of life in the scenes mentioned above during the 2022 Shanghai lockdown from people who self-identified as queer.

The project is meant to archive the emotions and feelings of ordinary people, which are undercovered mainly by the official media streams, as these narratives of how the public lives a life are unnecessary or less important compared to the rendering of heroic storytelling of the COVID-19 front line.</p>","img":"Shanghai_Lockdown_Queer_Life_0.jpg","caption":"This drawing illustrated a group of queer people living in a shared house in Shanghai discussing how to snatch groceries through a mobile app."},{"author":"Felix Li","pronouns":"he/him","bio":"Felix Li is currently studying Art and Design, and Comparative Media Studies at MIT.","link":"mailto:felixli@mit.edu","title_short":"/s/ /z/","title":"/s/ /z/","abstract":"<p>/s/ /z/ is a personal voice archive that wedges speech therapy practices, mimicry, and repetition.

This research aims to provide and display embodied knowledge that could carry a value-driven lifestyle enhancement in society but cannot be preserved using conventional archiving formats to fill in the gaps in the archives and give the silences a voice.

The first way is the “image” of the institution. The image is the official way an institution wishes to be read by the public. The second way of reading an institution is through its “presence.”  Presence is the reciprocal relationship and shaping between the institution and those interacting with it. The latter relationship of presence is often unacknowledged because it troubles the logical reading of an institution\'s image. The library as an institution is par excellence an archival space dedicated to the official telling of history and distribution of information.</p><img src=\'/images/minor_presence_0.jpg\'><p>This initial part of our project is the first trip into a series of questions we are engaging with about the institutional library as a space. It is divided into 5 reflections. In reflection 1, we discussed our use of a queer methodology through the frame of the minor. Reflections 2 and 3 gave a brief historical account of the library as an institutional space and looked into Harvard’s Lamont library as a case study. Reflection 4 helps us to pin down a few key definitions. Through the framework of the minor, we introduce the distinction between the image of a space and its presence. To conclude we reflect on the potentialities that come from remixing, reordering, and redistributing the popular.</p><p>We have been writing these reflections asynchronously, and as we write along, they are increasingly in conversation with each other. Weaving together these 5 pairs of loosely defined reflections, we hope to present our intention towards remixing knowledge in different contexts, and producing a “messy” research project that hesitates to be fully linear in direction.</p> ","img":"minor_presence_0.jpg","caption":"A Map of Turkey with the Pride Flag Overlayed (2022)."},{"author":"Caroline Chea","title_short":"(In)visibility of Asexuality","title":"(In)visibility of Asexuality: Self-identification Through Online Communities","abstract":"<p>From the outside of the umbrella, all that is visible is the black canopy and rainbow lining.

One of the first ace communities was the comments section of the article “My life as an amoeba” (1997). Other forum communities were established and populated in the early 2000s: Yahoo!

Pride marches that publicly showcase the act of leaving the closet and going on to the street since the 1970s are embraced as a cultural tradition nowadays. Unfortunately, this level of visibility is not enjoyed all over the globe. LGBTQ identifying individuals in many countries today still face strong social, if not legal, resistance to publicly being and living as who they are.  During my time in China, the silence that suppresses the public expression of LGBTQ identity was strongly felt with the strangers’ stares on the streets and the broken link of related blogs resulting from censoring. Although legal prosecution was lifted in the late 90s, the societal and institutional discrimination against being out with one’s LGBTQ identity in public remains persistent, and perhaps even strengthened in the recent yeats. Therefore, through Queer Space Lab, I researched the life of LGBTQ-identifying youths China, the communities that supports them, and the pressure, challenges, and supressions they face from cultural and institutional discrimination. Modeled from one of the currently best selling closets on taobao.com, the most popular online shopping platform in China, this project explores the situation of LGBTQ youths in modern China through closeting a collection of tokens for items, events, languages, or art that had been forced into the background or out of public sight.</p>","caption":"Women’s Independent Living Group at MIT (n.d.).
