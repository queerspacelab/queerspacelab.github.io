<!--    <h3>Introduction</h3>-->
<!--    <p>-->
<!--      Since COVID-19 first broke out in 2020, China has performed a zero-tolerance policy combating the public health crisis, including rounds of city-wide lockdown. The stringent lockdown policy, which never got lifted in the past two years, utilizes residential complexes (sub-districts) as control units and is considered the most effective way to limit the spread of cases in China. Following lockdowns, measurements such as the conduction of massive PCR testing across the city and the implementation of the green-code system to survey, monitor, and record individuals’ health conditions disrupted the pre-COVID daily routine to become the new norm. Many have adopted lockdown as an abnormal yet everyday lifestyle in the country, while others are actively seeking alternatives to bring back the daily life before COVID-19 and create a sense of belonging in the community despite the reality of physical isolation.-->
<!--    </p><p>-->
<!--    Early in 2022, Shanghai went through the most rigorous lockdown in the nation, where residents were, on average, quarantined for around sixty days at home without a single step out of the room. Food was in short supply, and snatching groceries through mobile apps seemed to be the only way to stock up the fridge. People anxiously awaited the announcement of the policy lift-up and updates on the resumption of work every day. Under such extreme conditions, people strive to fulfill their basic survival needs, taking less care of their other desires.-->
<!--  </p><p>-->
<!--    Socially, when most offline event spaces were confined to precautionary inspection, social media linked people together, helping form all kinds of virtual neighborhoods. Some of these were based on a chatgroup structure, though temporary, worked autonomously, and succeeded in providing members with resources to life supplies, medical services, and social support.-->
<!--  </p><p>-->
<!--    This project is a collection of slices of life in the scenes mentioned above during the Shanghai lockdown from people who self-identified as queer. It tries to reflect on their personal experience of seeking comfort in living space, adjusting distances between themselves and others, and redefining daily habits in the quarantine. The project is meant to archive the emotions and feelings of ordinary people, which are undercovered mainly by the official media streams, as these narratives of “how the public lives a life” are “unnecessary” or “less important” compared to the rendering of heroic story-telling of the COVID-19 front line.-->
<!--  </p>-->

<!--    <h3>Interview 1</h3>-->
<!--    <p>-->
<!--      I worked with this queer organization for about one year and spent my quarantine time in its offline gathering space, like I was living in this space for the entire lockdown, for 80 days. Actually, I wouldn't just call it an event space because it is also the shared living space for our core members. It's a place of both.-->
<!--    </p><p>-->
<!--    I think this space is a safe haven that always opens the door to LGBTQ+ people who may have trouble with life, work, relationship, or their primary families and may need support. They simply can find others who would share the same experience and resonate with them here. Things that wouldn't or couldn't be shared outside are allowed to be shared within this space. At the same time, it is a place that always welcomes people just to come and have fun. From my perspective, the social interaction within queer community in Shanghai relies heavily on offline events. The virtual platform and social media we use to advertise ourselves only supplement real-life experiences instead of replacing them.-->
<!--  </p><p>-->
<!--    Compared to hanging out with friends at a bar or club, some people prefer to do grocery shopping and cook meals together. For them, a family-gathering-like party is better than a social event. And for many organizations, the place they share to live in is treated as the queer space to host these family gatherings.-->
<!--  </p><p>-->
<!--    We usually start by meeting each other offline and maintaining closer relationships with a smaller group of people. Old friends will introduce new friends, and that's how the organization grows. That was before quarantine, though. We didn't gain much expansion over the pandemic.-->
<!--  </p><p>-->
<!--    The core members of this organization, around 6 of us, live together under one roof as a family. We can call it a diverse family that is diversified in structure and personality. I believe many Shanghai organizations practice a similar system of queer space to ours. But still, I don't think there are enough of them.-->
<!--  </p><p>-->
<!--    We are a group of 21-23 years old, fresh out of college or working entry-level positions in the job market. In general, members range from 17 years old to 30 years old.-->
<!--  </p><p>-->
<!--    I chose to live here because of the location and financial concerns, which applies to most of our core members' cases. But the lockdown has changed a lot of things. Our priority shifted from running the queer space to focusing on the urgency of living. I found it hard to move my eyes away from internal issues and frictions which were not as visible as before the pandemic. Regarding how little space we had for the number of people living in it, the physical isolation made everyone's pressure and anxiety so explicit that seeing each other 24/7 became unbearable.-->
<!--  </p><p>-->
<!--    Plus, the lockdown policy changed on a daily basis, which we have zero control over. No matter how hard we try to prepare beforehand, we never feel ready for the ever-changing policy and quarantine management.-->
<!--  </p><p>-->
<!--    As soon as we decided to work collaboratively to gather information, stock up grocery, and prepare food and life supplies, I found it almost impossible to keep up with others in contributing to the group even though I was willing to participate in most of the daily routines. I took responsibility for food prep, but that was too few tasks from others' perspectives. I  was struggling with my ASD(Autism Spectrum Disorder) at the time, and I had a tough time setting boundaries between the rest of the group and myself. I strived but couldn't successfully articulate my hope of taking more time to accommodate the changes and adjust my position in the group structure.-->
<!--  </p><p>-->
<!--    Things that are easy for them weren't easy for me. And nobody understood my difficulty. For them, I was way too relaxed to take over any sig jobs while panicking about how to do more to help.-->
<!--  </p><p>-->
<!--    I got pushed into a "double minority "zone where I realized being the different one in an LGBTQ+ group didn't make it easier for people to accept you and show respect for your personality. Not being able to act just like others made my effort underrecognized.-->
<!--  </p><p>-->
<!--    As most of us are self-identified as queer women, we've frequently discussed what feminism means to our community and why we should care about the feminine characteristics we present in the community. However, some of us seem to agree upon a perfect image of women as the non-negotiable model everyone else should follow. Women's power, which in our case translated into a person being caring, kind, attentive, and willing to self-giving, becomes the standard of action.-->
<!--  </p><p>-->
<!--    The pandemic not only cut off our offline activities but also the physical and mental connection we grew between our intimate community off the Internet.-->
<!--  </p><p>-->
<!--    Members closer to the imagery tend to have a say in arranging our daily tasks. You can imagine those who act more like a mother running a big family will win more respect over others.-->
<!--  </p><p>-->
<!--    There is a member who will actively take on the responsibility and take care of others before others even ask for it. I sometimes was explicitly targeted for not putting effort into appreciating her work and trying to catch up with her. I understood that she was anxious and deserved the acknowledgment of what she had been doing, but I also believe expecting everyone to perform the same standard and hoping a single method would solve the complicated problem wasn't the ideal way.-->
<!--  </p><p>-->
<!--    Although I actively sought ways to mitigate the situation, I gradually felt isolated again, as others started to argue against me and not engage me in daily activities.-->
